# The plugin will check to see if any horses are left out from the cache on a regular interval, potentially fixing any issues.
# This is the amount of time in minutes between each cache clear. Note that this may cause a little lag.
# You may set this to 0 or a negative number to disable the cache verification (not recommended).
verify-cache-interval: 60

# In order for horses to be able to eat seeds and drink water outside of player range, chunks need to be loaded around the horse, just like
# how they are loaded around a player. This number is how many far out chunks are loaded. For example, 1 would load chunks 1 chunk away, 2 would load
# chunks 2 chunks away (3x3 square of chunks), and so on. Increasing this number will increase the distance at which horses can pathfind, however
# it will also increase the amount of lag that is caused by loading chunks.
horse-chunk-distance: 3

# This is how many "steps" are taken to finding a path, such as a path to a brewing stand, grass block, or a drinkable water source. The larger
# this number is, the faster horses will pathfind. However, a larger value will also increase the amount of entity lag. For reference,
# a value of 20 will take an average of 13 seconds to find a path.
